@deftypefun {int} {gnutls_ocsp_status_request_is_checked} (gnutls_session_t @var{session}, unsigned int @var{flags})
@var{session}: is a gnutls session

@var{flags}: should be zero or @code{GNUTLS_OCSP_SR_IS_AVAIL} 

Check whether an OCSP status response was included in the handshake
and whether it was checked and valid (not too old or superseded). 
This is a helper function when needing to decide whether to perform an
OCSP validity check on the peer's certificate. Should be called after
any of gnutls_certificate_verify_peers*() are called.

If the flag @code{GNUTLS_OCSP_SR_IS_AVAIL}  is specified, the return
value of the function indicates whether an OCSP status response have
been received (even if invalid). The flag was introduced in GnuTLS 3.4.0.

@strong{Returns:} non zero if the response was valid, or a zero if it wasn't sent,
or sent and was invalid.
@end deftypefun
