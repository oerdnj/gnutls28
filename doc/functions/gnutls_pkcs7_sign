@var{pkcs7}: should contain a @code{gnutls_pkcs7_t}  type

@var{signer}: the certificate believe to have signed the structure

@var{signer_key}: -- undescribed --

@var{data}: The data to be signed or @code{NULL}  if the data are already embedded

@var{signed_attrs}: Any additional attributes to be included in the signed ones (or @code{NULL} )

@var{unsigned_attrs}: Any additional attributes to be included in the unsigned ones (or @code{NULL} )

@var{dig}: The digest algorithm to use for signing

@var{flags}: Should be zero or one of @code{GNUTLS_PKCS7}  flags

This function will add a signature in the provided PKCS @code{7}  structure
for the provided data. Multiple signatures can be made with different
signers.

The available flags are:
- @code{GNUTLS_PKCS7_EMBED_DATA} : the data will be embedded in the structure
- @code{GNUTLS_PKCS7_INCLUDE_TIME} : the signing time will be included
- @code{GNUTLS_PKCS7_INCLUDE_CERT} : the signer's certificate will be included in the cert list
- @code{GNUTLS_PKCS7_WRITE_SPKI} : store the issuer's ID instead of name

@strong{Returns:} On success, @code{GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS}  (0) is returned, otherwise a
negative error value. 

@strong{Since:} 3.4.2
