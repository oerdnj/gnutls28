@deftypefun {int} {gnutls_x509_crt_import_url} (gnutls_x509_crt_t @var{crt}, const char * @var{url}, unsigned int @var{flags})
@var{crt}: A certificate of type @code{gnutls_x509_crt_t} 

@var{url}: A PKCS 11 url

@var{flags}: One of GNUTLS_PKCS11_OBJ_* flags

This function will import a PKCS 11 certificate directly from a token
without involving the @code{gnutls_pkcs11_obj_t}  type. This function will
fail if the certificate stored is not of X.509 type.

Despite its name this function will attempt to import any kind of 
URL to certificate. In previous versions of gnutls this function
was named gnutls_x509_crt_import_pkcs11_url, and the old name is
an alias to this one.

@strong{Returns:} On success, @code{GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS}  (0) is returned, otherwise a
negative error value.

@strong{Since:} 3.4.0
